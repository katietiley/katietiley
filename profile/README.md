Current PhD student on the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme (LIDo) funded by the BBSRC.

Interested in infectious disease epidemiology, especially the intersection of disease, climate, and ecology; I'm passionate about my work having an impact on public health and policy.

My current work at LSHTM involves modelling the application of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for dengue control, using dynamical population models in R and Python.

Previously completed an MSc in Epidemiology at Imperial, using Bayesian spatiotemporal modelling to explore the interactions between climate, ecology and West Nile Virus prevalence. I obtained a fully funded MRes at Ross University, St Kitts, studying the pathology of queen conch - a commercially significant marine species in the Caribbean. Prior to that, I achieved a first class honours degree in Zoology from the University of Exeter.
